Description of the cacheLoader Function

The cacheLoader function is designed to optimize the performance of Symfony applications by reducing the number of queries to the database.

    Usage: {{ cacheLoader("customer", "1").first_name }}
    Parameters:
        "customer": The name of the table to load from the database.
        "1": The identifier (ID) of the specific record to retrieve.
    Result: The function returns an object containing the columns of the corresponding record. In this example, it directly accesses the first_name column.

Advantages:

    Automatic Caching: By storing results in cache, the function helps avoid repetitive queries, thus improving application responsiveness.
    Ease of Use: Developers can easily retrieve data using a clear and concise syntax in Twig templates.

Conclusion:

This feature, integrated into your Symfony bundle, represents a powerful tool for optimizing data access while simplifying the logic of templates.
